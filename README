# Developer Portal Prototype

Welcome to the Developer Portal Prototype GitHub repository!

This prototype is designed to showcase the use of OpenAPI 3.0 specifications to provide developers with a comprehensive and standardized way to access and understand the APIs and resources available to them. The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly and intuitive interface that adheres to the OpenAPI specification and provides developers with the information they need to quickly and efficiently build applications.

The prototype includes features such as API documentation, sample code, tutorials, all built on top of the OpenAPI 3.0 specification. It is built using [Docusaurus v2](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) and [Docusaurus OpenAPI Doc Generator](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/docusaurus-openapi-docs).

We encourage contributions from the developer community to help us improve the prototype and make it more useful for developers. Whether you want to report a bug, suggest a new feature, or submit a pull request, we welcome your input.

Thank you for your interest in the Developer Portal Prototype using OpenAPI 3.0 specifications. We look forward to working with you!
